					<h3 epub:type="title">Transformation of Arachne Into a Spider</h3>
					<p epub:type="bridgehead">Arachne presumes to challenge Minerva to a trial of skill in needlework⁠—Being defeated, she hangs herself in despair, and is changed into a spider by the goddess.</p>
				</header>
				<p>
					<span>Pallas, attending to the muse’s song,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Approved the just resentment of their wrong,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thus reflects: “While tamely I commend</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Those who their injured deities defend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My own divinity affronted stands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And calls aloud for justice at my hands;”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then takes the hint, ashamed to lag behind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And on Arachne bends her vengeful mind;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One at the loom so excellently skill’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That to the goddess she refused to yield.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Low was her birth, and small her native town:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She from her art alone obtain’d renown.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Idmon, her father, made it his employ</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To give the spongy fleece a purple die:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of vulgar strain her, mother, lately dead,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With her own rank had been content to wed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet she their daughter, though her time was spent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In a small hamlet, and of mean descent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through the great towns of Lydia gain’d a name,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And fill’d the neighb’ring countries with her fame.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Oft, to admire the niceness of her skill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The nymphs would quit their fountain, shade, or hill;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thither, from green Tymolus, they repair,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And leave the vineyards, their peculiar care:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thither, from famed Partolus’ golden stream,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Drawn by her art, the curious Naiads came:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor would the work, when finish’d, please so much,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As, while she wrought, to view each graceful touch:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whether the shapeless wool in balls she wound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or with quick motion turn’d the spindle round,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or with her pencil drew the neat design,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pallas, her mistress, shone in every line.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This the proud maid, with scornful air, denies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And ev’n the goddess at her work defies;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Disowns her heavenly mistress every hour,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor asks her aid, nor deprecates her power.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Let us,” she cries, “but to a trial come,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, if she conquers, let her fix my doom.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The goddess then a beldam’s form put on;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With silver hairs her hoary temples shone;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Propp’d hy a staff, she hobbles in her walk,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, tottering, thus begins her old wives’ talk:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Young maid attend, nor stubbornly despise</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The admonitions of the old and wise;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For age, though scorn’d, a ripe experience bears,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That golden fruit, unknown to blooming years:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Still may remotest fame your labours crown,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And mortals your superior genius own;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But to the goddess yield, and, humbly meek,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A pardon for your bold presumption seek:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The goddess will forgive.” At this the maid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With passion fired, her gliding shuttle stay’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, darting vengeance, with an angry look,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To Pallas in disguise thus fiercely spoke:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Thou doting thing, whose idle, babbling tongue</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But too well shows the plague of living long,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hence, and reprove, with this your sage advice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your giddy daughter, or your awkward niece:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Know I despise your counsel, and an still</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A woman, ever wedded to my will;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, if your skilful goddess better knows,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let her accept the trial I propose.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“She does,” impatient Pallas straight replies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, clothed with heavenly light, sprung from her odd disguise.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The nymphs and virgins of the plain adore</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The awful goddess, and confess her power:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The maid alone stood unappall’d, yet show’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A transient blush, that for a moment glow’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then disappear’d, as purple streaks adorn</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The opening beauties of the rosy morn;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till Phoebus, rising prevalently bright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Allays the tincture with his silver light.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet she persists, and, obstinately great,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In hopes of conquest, hurries on her fate.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The goddess now the challenge waves no more,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor, kindly good, advises as before.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Straight to their posts appointed both repair,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And fix their threaded looms with equal care:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Around the solid beam the web is tied,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While hollow canes the parting warp divide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through which, with nimble flight, the shuttles play,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And for the woof prepare a ready way:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The woof and warp unite, press’d by the toothy sley.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thus both, their mantles button’d to their breast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their skilful fingers play with willing haste,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And work with pleasure, while they cheer the eye</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With glowing purple of the Tyrian die:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or, justly intermixing shades with light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their colourings insensibly unite.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As when a shower, transpierced with sunny rays,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Its mighty arch along the heaven displays,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From whence a thousand different colours rise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whose fine transition cheats the clearest eyes:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So like the intermingled shading seems,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And only differs in the last extremes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then threads of gold both artfully dispose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, as each part in just proportion rose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some antique fable in their work disclose.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Pallas in figures wrought the heavenly powers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Mars’s hill among the Athenian towers:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On lofty thrones twice six celestials sate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Jove in the midst, and held their warm debate;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The subject weighty, and well known to fame.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“From whom the city should receive its name.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Each god by proper features was express’d;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Jove, with majestic mien, excell’d the rest:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His three-fork’d mace the dewy sea-god shook,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, looking sternly, smote the ragged rock,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When from the stone leap’d forth a sprightly steed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Neptune claims the city for the deed.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Herself she blazons, with a glittering spear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And crested helm, that veil’d her braided hair,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With shields, and scaly breastplate, implements of war.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Struck with her pointed lance, the teeming earth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seem’d to produce a new surprising birth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When, from the glebe, the pledge of conquest sprung⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A tree pale green, with fairest olives hung.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And then, to let her giddy rival learn</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What just rewards such boldness was to earn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Four trials at each corner had their part,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Design’d in miniature, and touch’d with art.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Haemus in one, and Rhodope of Thrace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Transform’d to mountains, fill’d the foremost place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who claim’d the titles of the gods above,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And vainly used the epithets of Jove.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Another show’d where the Pigmaean dame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Profaning Juno’s venerable name,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Turn’d to an airy crane, descends from far,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with her pygmy subjects wages war.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In a third part, the rage of heaven’s great queen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Display’d on proud Antigone, was seen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who, with presumptuous boldness, dared to vie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For beauty, with the emperess of the sky.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ah! what avails her ancient princely race;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her sire a king, and Troy her native place?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now, to a noisy stork transform’d, she flies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with her whiten’d pinions cleaves the skies:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in the last remaining part was drawn</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Poor Cinyras, that seem’d to weep in stone;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Clasping the temple steps, ne sadly mourn’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His lovely daughters, now to marble turn’d.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With her own tree the finish’d piece is crown’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And wreaths of peaceful olive all the work surround.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Arachne drew the famed intrigues of Jove,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Changed to a bull, to gratify his love;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How through the briny tide, all foaming hoar,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lovely Europa on his back he bore.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sea seem’d waving, and the trembling maid</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shrunk up her tender feet, as if afraid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, looking back on the forsaken strand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To her companions wafts her distant hand.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Next she design’d Asteria’s fabled rape,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When Jove assumed a soaring eagle’s shape:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And show’d how Leda lay supinely press’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While the soft snowy swan sat hovering o’er her breast:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How in a satyr’s form the god beguiled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When fair Antiope with twins he fill’d:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then, like Amphitryon, but a real Jove,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In fair Alcmena’s arms he cool’d his love:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In fluid gold to Danae’s heart he came:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Aegina felt him in a lambent flame:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He took Mnemosyne in shepherd’s make</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And for Deois was a speckled snake.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>She made thee, Neptune, like a wanton steer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pacing the meads for love of Arne dear:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Next, like a stream, thy burning flame to slake;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And like a ram, for fair Bisaltis’ sake.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then Ceres in a steed your vigour tried,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor could the mare the yellow goddess hide:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Next, to a fowl transform’d, you won by force</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The snake-hair’d mother of the winged horse;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, in a dolphin’s fishy form, subdued</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Melantho sweet, beneath the oozy flood.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>All these the maid with lively features drew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And open’d proper landscapes to the view.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There Phobus, roving like a country swain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Attunes his jolly pipe along the plain;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For lovely Isso’s sake, in stepherd’s weeds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O’er pastures green his bleating flock he feeds.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There Bacchus, imaged like the clustering grape,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Melting, bedrops Erigone’s fair lap:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And there old Saturn, stung with youthful heat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Form’d like a stallion, rushes to the feat.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fresh flowers, which twists of ivy intertwine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mingling a running foliage, close the neat design.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This the bright goddess, passionately moved,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With envy saw, yet inwardly approved.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The scene of heavenly guilt with haste she tore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor longer the affront with patience bore:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A boxen shuttle in her hand she took,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And more than once Arachne’s forehead struck.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The unhappy maid, impatient of the wrong,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Down from a beam her injured person hung;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When Pallas, pitying her wretched state,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At once prevented and pronounced her fate:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Live; but depend, vile wretch,” the goddess cried,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Doom’d in suspense for ever to be tied;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That all your race, to utmost date of time,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>May feel the vengeance, and detest the crime.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then, going off, she sprinkled her with juice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which leaves of baneful aconite produced.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Touch’d with the pois’nous drug, her flowing hair</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fell to the ground, and left her temples bare;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her usual features vanish’d from their place</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her body lessen’d all, but most her face:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her slender fingers, hanging on each side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With many joints, the use of legs supplied;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A spider’s bag the rest, from which she gives</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A thread, and still by constant weaving lives.</span>

					<h3 epub:type="title">Story of Niobe</h3>
					<p epub:type="bridgehead">Niobe, the daughter of Tantalus, is united in marriage to Amphion, by whom she has seven sons and as many daughters⁠—She has the imprudence to exalt herself above Latona, who entreats her children to punish the arrogant Niobe⁠—Her prayers are heard, and all the sons expire by the shafts of Apollo, while the daughters are in like manner destroyed by Diana⁠—Amphion, in despair, puts a period to his existence.</p>
				</header>
				<p>
					<span>Swift through the Phrygian towns the rumour flies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the strange news each female tongue employs:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Niobe, who, before she married, knew</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The famous nymph, now found the story true;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet, unreclaim’d by poor Arachne’s fate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Vainly above the gods assumed a state.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her husband’s fame, their family’s descent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their power, and rich dominions’ wide extent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Might well have justified a decent pride:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But not on these alone the dame relied.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her lovely progeny, that far excell’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The mother’s heart with vain ambition swell’d:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The happiest mother not unjustly styled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had no conceited thoughts her tow’ring fancy fill’d.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For once a prophetess, with zeal inspired,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their slow neglect to warm devotion fired;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through every street of Thebes who ran possess’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thus, in accents wild, her charge express’d:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Haste, haste, ye Theban matrons, and adore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With hallow’d rites, Latona’s mighty power,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to the heavenly twins that from her spring,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With laurel crown’d, your smoking incense bring.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Straight the great summons every dame obey’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And due submission to the goddess paid:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Graceful, with laurel chaplets dress’d, they came,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And offer’d incense in the sacred flame.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Meanwhile, surrounded with a courtly guard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The royal Niobe in state appear’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Attired in robes embroider’d o’er with gold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And mad with rage, yet lovely to behold;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her comely tresses, trembling as she stood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Down her fine neck with easy motion flow’d;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then, darting round a proud, disdainful look,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In haughty tone her hasty passion broke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thus began: “What madness this, to court</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A goddess, founded merely on report?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dare ye a poor pretended power invoke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While yet no altars to my godhead smoke?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mine, whose immediate lineage stands confess’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From Tantalus, the only mortal guest</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That e’er the gods admitted to their feast.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A sister of the Pleiads gave me birth;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Atlas, mightiest mountain upon earth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who bears the globe of all the stars above,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My grandsire was; and Atlas sprung from Jove.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Theban towns my majesty adore;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And neighb’ring Phrygia trembles at my power;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Raised by my husband’s lute, with turrets crown’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our lofty city stands secured around;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Within my court, where’er I turn my eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unbounded treasures to my prospect rise;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With these, my face I modestly may name</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As not unworthy of so high a claim.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seven are my daughters, of a form divine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With seven fair sons, an indefective line.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Go, fools! consider this, and ask the cause</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From which my pride its strong presumption draws;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Consider this, and then prefer to me</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Caeus the Titan’s vagrant progeny,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To whom, in travail, the whole spacious earth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No room afforded for her spurious birth;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not the least part in earth, in heaven, or seas,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Would grant your outlaw’d goddess any ease,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till, pitying hers, from his own wandering case,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Delos, the floating island, gave a place;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There she a mother was of two at most;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Only the seventh part of what I boast.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My joys all are beyond suspicion fix’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With no pollutions of misfortune mix’d;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Safe on the basis of my power I stand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Above the reach of Fortune’s fickle hand;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lessen she may my inexhausted store,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And much destroy, yet still must leave me more.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Suppose it possible that some may die</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of this my numerous, lovely progeny,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Still with Latona I might safely vie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who, by her scanty breed, scarce fit to name,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But just escapes the childless woman’s shame.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Go then, with speed your laurell’d heads uncrown,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And leave the silly farce you have begun.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The tim’rous throng their sacred rites forbore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And from their heads the verdant laurel tore;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their haughty queen they with regret obey’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And still in gentle murmurs softly pray’d.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>High on the top of Cynthus’ shady mount,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With grief the goddess saw the base affront,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, the abuse revolving in her breast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The mother her twin offspring thus address’d:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Lo I, my children, who with comfort knew</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your godlike birth, and thence my glory drew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thence have claim’d precedency of place</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From all but Juno of the heavenly race,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Must now despair, and languish in disgrace.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My godhead question’d, and all rites divine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unless you succour, banish’d from my shrine:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nay, more, the imp of Tantalus has flung</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Reflections with her vile paternal tongue:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Has dared prefer her mortal breed to mine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And call’d me childless, which, just Fate, may she repine!”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>When to urge more the goddess was prepared,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Phoebus in haste replies: “Too much we’ve heard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And every moment’s lost while vengeance is deferr’d.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Diana spoke the same. Then both enshroud</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their heavenly bodies in a sable cloud,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to the Theban towers descending light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through the soft yielding air direct their flight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Without the wall there lies a champaign ground,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With even surface, far extending round,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beaten and levell’d, while it daily feels</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The trampling horse, and chariot’s grinding wheels.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Part of proud Niobe’s young rival breed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Practising there to ride the managed steed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their bridles boss’d with gold, were mounted high</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On stately furniture of Tyrian die.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of these, Ismenos, who by birth had been</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The first fair issue of the fruitful queen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Just as he drew the rein, to guide his horse</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Around the compass of the circling course,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sigh’d deeply, and the pangs of smart express’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While the shaft stuck, engored within his breast;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, the reins dropping from his dying hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He sunk quite down, and tumbled on the sand.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sipylus next the rattling quiver heard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with full speed for his escape prepared.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As when the pilot from the black’ning skies</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A gathering storm of wintry rain descries,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His sails unfurl’d, and crowded all with wind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He strives to leave the threat’ning cloud behind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So fled the youth; but an unerring dart</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O’ertook him, quick discharged, and sped with art;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fix’d in his neck behind it trembling stood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And at his throat display’d the point besmear’d with blood:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Prone as his posture was, he tumbled o’er,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bathed his courser’s mane with steaming gore.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Next at young Phaedimus they took their aim,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Tantalus, who bore his grandsire’s name;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These, when their other exercise was done,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To try the wrestler’s oily sport begun,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, straining every nerve, their skill express’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In closest grapple, joining breast to breast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When from the bending bow an arrow sent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Join’d as they were, through both their bodies went;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Both groan’d, and writhing both their limbs with pain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They fell together, bleeding on the plain;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then both their languid eyeballs faintly roll,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thus together breathe away their soul.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With grief Alphenor saw their doleful plight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And smote his breast, and sicken’d at the sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then to their succour ran, with eager haste,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, fondly grieved, their stiff’ning limbs embraced;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But in the action falls: a thrilling dart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By Phoebus guided, pierced him to the heart:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This, as they drew forth, his midriff tore:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Its barbed point the fleshy fragments bore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And let the soul gush out in streams of purple gore.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But Damasichthon, by a double wound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beardless and young, lay gasping on the ground:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fix’d in his sinewy ham, the steely point,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Stuck through his knee, and pierced the nervous joint;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as he stoop’d to tug the painful dart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Another stuck him in a vital part;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shot through his windpipe, by the wing it hung,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The life-blood forced it out, and darting upward sprung.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ilioneus, the last, with terror stands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lifting in prayer his unavailing hands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And ignorant from whom his griefs arise;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Spare me, O all ye heavenly powers,” he cries.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Phoebus was touch’d too late; the sounding bow</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had sent the shaft, and struck the fatal blow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which yet but gently gored his tender side;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So by a slight and easy wound he died.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Swift to the mother’s ears the rumour came,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And doleful sighs the heavy news proclaim.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With anger and surprise inflamed by turns,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In furious rage her haughty stomach burns.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>First she disputes the effects of heavenly power;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then at their daring boldness wonders more;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For poor Amphion, with sore grief distress’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hoping to sooth his cares by endless rest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had sheathed a dagger in his wretched breast:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And she who toss’d her high disdainful head</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When through the streets, in solemn pomp, she led</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The throng that from Latona’s altar fled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Assuming state beyond the proudest queen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was now the miserablest object seen:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Prostrate among the clay-cold dead she fell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And kiss’d an undistinguish’d, last farewell;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then, her pale arms advancing to the skies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Cruel Latona! triumph now,” she cries.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“My grieving soul in bitter anguish drench,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with my woes your thirsty passion quench,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Feast your black malice at a price thus dear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While the sore pangs of seven such deaths I bear.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Triumph, too cruel rival, and display</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your conquering standard, for you’ve won the day;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet I’ll excel; for yet, though seven are slain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Superior still in number I remain.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Scarce had she spoke, the bow-string’s twanging sound</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was heard, and dealt fresh terrors all around,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which all, but Niobe alone, confound.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Stunn’d and obdurate by her load of grief,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Insensible she sits, nor hopes relief.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Before the funeral biers, all weeping sad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her daughters stood, in vests of sable clad.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When one surprised, and stung with sudden smart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In vain attempts to draw the sticking dart;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But to grim death her blooming youth resigns,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And o’er her brother’s corpse her dying head reclines;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This, to assuage her mother’s anguish tries,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, silenced in the pious action, dies;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shot by a secret arrow, wing’d with death,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her falt’ring lips but only gasp’d for breath.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One, on her dying sister, breathes her last;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Vainly in flight another’s hopes are placed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This, hiding from her fate, a shelter seeks;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That trembling stands, and fills the air with shrieks</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all in vain; for now all six had found</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their way to death, each by a diff’rent wound.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The last, with eager care, the mother veil’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Behind her spreading mantle close conceal’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with her body guarded, as a shield.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Only for this, this youngest, I implore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Grant me this one request, I ask no more;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O grant me this!” she passionately cries:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, while she speaks, the destined virgin dies.</span>

					<h3 epub:type="title">Peasants of Lycia Transformed to Frogs</h3>
					<p epub:type="bridgehead">The goddess Latona, while concealing herself from the rage of Juno, arrives in Lycia, where she is insulted and ridiculed hy peasants, of whom she begs a draught of water, while they are weeding a marsh⁠—Their refusal and insolence provoke her, and she implores Jupiter to punish their barbarity⁠—The god consents, and transforms them into frogs.</p>
				</header>
				<p>
					<span>Then all, reclaim’d by this example, show’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A due regard for each peculiar god:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Both men and women their devoirs express’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And great Latona’s awful power confess’d.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then, tracing instances of older time,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To suit the nature of the present crime,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus one begins his tale:⁠—“Where Lycia yields</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A golden harvest from its fertile fields,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some churlish peasants, in the days of yore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Provoked the goddess to exert her power.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The thing, indeed, the meanness of the place</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Has made obscure, surprising as it was;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But I myself once happen’d to behold</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This famous lake, of which the story’s told.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My father, then, worn out by length of days,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor able to sustain the tedious ways,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Me with a guide had sent the plains to roam,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And drive his well-fed straggling heifers home.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here, as we saunter’d through the verdant meads,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We spied a lake o’ergrown with trembling reeds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whose wavy tops an op’ning scene disclose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From which an antique smoky altar rose.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I, as my superstitious guide had done,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Stopp’d short, and bless’d myself, and then went on</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet I inquired to whom the altar stood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Faunus, the Naiads, or some native god?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘No sylvan deity,’ my friend replies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘Enshrined within this hallow’d altar lies:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For this, O youth, to that famed goddess stands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whom, at the imperial Juno’s rough commands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of ev’ry quarter of the earth bereaved,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Delos, the floating isle, at length received;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who there, in spite of enemies, brought forth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beneath an olive shade, her great twin birth.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“ ‘Hence too she fled the furious stepdame’s power</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in her arms a double godhead bore;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And now the borders of fair Lycia gain’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Just when the summer solstice parch’d the land.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With thirst the goddess languishing, no more</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her emptied breast would yield its milky store,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When, from below, the smiling valley show’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A silver lake that in its bottom flow’d:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A sort of clowns were reaping, near the bank,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The bending osier, and the bulrush dank,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The cress, and water-lily, fragrant weed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whose juicy stalk the liquid fountains feed:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The goddess came, and kneeling on the brink,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Stoop’d at the fresh repast, prepared to drink.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then thus, being hinder’d by the rabble race,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In accents mild, expostulates the case:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Water I only ask, and sure ’tis hard</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From Nature’s common rights to be debarr’d:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This, as the genial sun, and vital air,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Should flow alike to ev’ry creature’s share.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet still I ask, and as a favour crave,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That which a public bounty nature gave:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor do I seek my weary limbs to drench,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Only, with one cool draught, my thirst I’d quench.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now from my throat the usual moisture dries,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And ev’n my voice in broken accents dies:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One draught as dear as life I should esteem,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And water, now I thirst, would nectar seem:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O! let my little babes your pity move,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And melt your hearts to charitable love;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They (as by chance they did) extend to you</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their little hands, and my request pursue.” ’</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Whom would these soft persuasions not subdue,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though the most rustic and unmanner’d crew?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet they the goddess’s request refuse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with rude words reproachfully abuse.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nay, more, with spiteful feet the villains trode</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O’er the soft bottom of the marshy flood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And blacken’d all the lake with clouds of rising mud.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Her thirst, by indignation, was suppress’d;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bent on revenge, the goddess stood confess’d.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her suppliant hands uplifting to the skies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For a redress to heaven she now applies:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘And may you live,’ she passionately cried,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘Doom’d in that pool for ever to abide.’</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“The goddess has her wish: for now they choose</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To plunge and dive among the watery ooze;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sometimes they show their head above the brim,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And on the glassy surface spread to swim;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Often upon the bank their station take,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then spring and leap into the cooly lake.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Still, void of shame, they lead a clam’rous life.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, croaking, still scold on in endless strife;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Compell’d to live beneath the liquid stream,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where still they quarrel, and attempt to scream.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now, from their bloated throat, their voice puts on</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Imperfect murmurs in a hoarser tone;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their noisy jaws, with bawling now grown wide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An ugly sight! extend on either side;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their motley back, streak’d with a list of green,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Join’d to their head, without a neck, is seen;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, with a belly broad and white, they look</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mere frogs, and still frequent the muddy brook.”</span>

					<span>And rich Messene with its fertile vale;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pylos for Nestor’s city after famed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Troezen, not as yet from Pittheus named;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And those fair cities, which are hemm’d around</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By double seas within the Isthmian ground;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And those which farther from the seacoast stand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lodged in the bosom of the spacious land.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Who can believe it? Athens was the last,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though for politeness famed for ages past:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For a strait siege, which then their walls enclosed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such acts of kind humanity opposed:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thick with ships, from foreign nations bound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seaward their city lay invested round.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>These, with auxiliar forces led from far,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tereus of Thrace, brave, and inured to war,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had quite defeated, and obtain’d a name,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The warrior’s due, among the sons of fame.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This, with his wealth, and power, and ancient line,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From Mars derived, Pandion’s thoughts incline</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His daughter Procne with the prince to join.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Nor Hymen, nor the Graces, here preside,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor Juno, to befriend the blooming bride;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But fiends with funeral brands the process led,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And furies waited at the genial bed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, all night long, the screeching owl aloof,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With baleful notes, sat brooding o’er the roof.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With such ill omens was the match begun,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That made them parents of a hopeful son.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now Thrace congratulates their seeming joy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And they, in thankful rites, their minds employ:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If the fair queen’s espousals pleased before,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Itys, the newborn prince, now pleases more;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And each bright day the birth and bridal feast</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were kept with hallow’d pomp above the rest.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So far true happiness may lie conceal’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When, by false lights, we fancy ’tis reveal’d!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now, since their nuptials, had the golden sun</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Five courses round his ample zodiac run,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When gentle Procne thus her lord address’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And spoke the secret wishes of her breast:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“If I,” she said, “have ever favour found,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let my petition with success be crown’d.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let me at Athens my dear sister see;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or, let her come to Thrace and visit me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, lest my father should her absence mourn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Promise that she shall make a quick return.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With thanks I’d own the obligation due,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Only, O Tereus, to the gods and you.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now, plied with oar and sail at his command,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The nimble galleys reach’d the Athenian land,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And anchor’d in the famed Piraean bay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While Tereus to the palace takes his way;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The king salutes, and, ceremonies pass’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Begins the fatal embassy at last:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The occasion of his voyage he declares,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, with his own, his wife’s request prefers;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Asks leave that, only for a little space,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their lovely sister might embark for Thrace.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thus, while he spoke, appear’d the royal maid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bright Philomela, splendidly array’d;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But most attractive in her charming face,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And comely person, turn’d with ev’ry grace:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like those fair nymphs that are described to rove</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Across the glades and op’nings of the grove;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Only that these are dress’d for sylvan sports,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And less become the finery of courts.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Tereus beheld the virgin, and admired,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with the coals of burning love was fired;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like crackling stubble, or the summer hay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When forked lightnings o’er the meadows play.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such charms in any breast might kindle love,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But him the heats of inbred passion move,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To which, though Thrace is naturally prone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet his is still superior, and his own.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Straight her attendants he designs to buy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with large bribes her governess would try;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Herself with ample gifts resolves to bend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And his whole kingdom in the attempt expend;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or, snatch’d away, by force of arms to bear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And justify the act with open war.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The boundless passion boils within his breast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And his projecting soul admits no rest.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And now, impatient of the least delay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By pleading Procne’s cause, he speeds his way:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The eloquence of love his tongue inspires,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, in his wife’s, he speaks his own desires;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hence all his importunities arise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And tears unmanly trickle from his eyes.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Ye gods! what thick involving darkness blinds</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The stupid faculties of mortal minds!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tereus the credit of good-nature gains</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From these his crimes; so well the villain feigns,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, unsuspecting of his base designs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the request fair Philomela joins;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her snowy arms her aged sire embrace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And clasp his neck with an endearing grace:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Only to see her sister she entreats,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A seeming blessing, which a curse completes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tereus surveys her with a luscious eye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in his mind forestalls the blissful joy:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her circling arms a scene of love inspire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And ev’ry kiss foments the raging fire.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fondly he wishes for the father’s place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To feel, and to return, the warm embrace;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Since not the nearest ties of filial blood</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Would damp his flame, and force him to be good.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>At length, for both their sakes, the king agrees;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Philomela, on her bended knees,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thanks him for what her fancy calls success,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When cruel Fate intends her nothing less.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now Phoebus, hast’ning to ambrosial rest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His fiery steeds drove sloping down the west;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sculptured gold with sparkling wines was fill’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, with rich meats, each cheerful table smiled.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Plenty and mirth the royal banquet close,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then all retire to sleep and sweet repose.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But the amorous monarch, though withdrawn apart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Still feels love’s poison rankling in his heart:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her face divine is stamp’d within his breast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fancy imagines, and improves the rest:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thus, kept waking by intense desire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He nourishes his own prevailing fire.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Next day the good old king for Tereus sends,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to his charge the virgin recommends:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His hand with tears the indulgent father press’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then spoke, and thus with tenderness address’d:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Since the kind instances of pious love</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Do all pretence of obstacle remove:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Since Procne’s, and her own, with your request,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O’errule the fears of a paternal breast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With you, dear son, my daughter I entrust,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, by the gods, adjure you to be just;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By truth, and ev’ry consanguineal tie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To watch and guard her with a father’s eye;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, since the least delay will tedious prove,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In keeping from my sight the child I love,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With speed return her, kindly to assuage</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The tedious troubles of my ling’ring age.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And you, my Philomel, let it suffice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To know your sister’s banish’d from my eyes;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If any sense of duty sways your mind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let me from you the shortest absence find.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He wept; then kiss’d his child; and while he speaks,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The tears fall gently down his aged cheeks.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Next, as a pledge of fealty, he demands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, with a solemn charge, conjoins their hands;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then to his daughter and his grandson sends,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And by their mouth a blessing recommends;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While, in a voice with dire forebodings broke.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sobbing and faint, the last farewell was spoke.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now Philomela, scarce received on board,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in the royal gilded bark secured,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beheld the dashes of the bending oar,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The ruffled sea, and the receding shore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When straight (his joy impatient of disguise)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“We’ve gain’d our point,” the rough barbarian cries;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now I possess the dear, the blissful hour,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And ev’ry wish subjected to my power.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As when the bold rapacious bird of Jove,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With crooked talons, stooping from above,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Has snatch’d, and carried to his lofty nest</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A captive hare, with cruel gripes oppress’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Secure, with fix’d and unrelenting eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He sits, and views the helpless, trembling prize.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Their vessels now had made the intended land.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all with joy descend upon the strand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When the false tyrant seized the princely maid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to a lodge in distant woods convey’d;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pale, sinking, and distress’d with jealous fears,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, asking for her sister, all in tears.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The monster, on his purpose fully bent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No longer now delay’d his base intent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her piercing accents to her sire complain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to her absent sister, but in vain;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In vain she importunes, with doleful cries,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Each unattentive godhead of the skies.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She pants and trembles like the bleating prey,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From some close-hunted wolf just snatch’d away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That still with fearful horror looks around,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And on its flank regards the bleeding wound:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or, as the tim’rous dove, the danger o’er,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beholds her shining plumes besmear’d with gore;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And though deliver’d from the falcon’s claw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet shivers, and retains a secret awe.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But when her mind a calm reflection shared,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all her scatter’d spirits were repaired,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Torn and disorder’d while her tresses hung,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her livid hands, like one that mourn’d, she wrung,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then thus, with grief o’erwhelmed her languid eyes:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Savage, inhuman, cruel wretch!” she cries,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Whom nor a parent’s strict commands could move,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though charged and utter’d with the tears of love,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor virgin innocence, nor all that’s due</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To the strong contract of the nuptial vow;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Virtue, by this, in wild confusion’s laid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I compelled to wrong my sister’s bed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While you, regardless of your marriage oath,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With stains of incest have defiled us both.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though I deserved some punishment to find,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This was, ye gods! too cruel and unkind.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet, villain, to complete your horrid guilt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Stab here, and let my tainted blood be spilt.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O! happy, had it come before I knew</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The cursed embrace of vile perfidious you;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then, my pale ghost, pure from incestuous love,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had wander’d spotless through the Elysian grove.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, if the gods above have power to know,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And judge those actions that are done below,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unless the dreaded thunders of the sky,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like me, subdued, and violated lie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Still my revenge shall take its proper time,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And suit the baseness of your hellish crime;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Myself abandon’d, and devoid of shame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through the wide world your actions will proclaim;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or, though I’m prison’d in this lonely den,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Obscured and buried from the sight of men,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My mournful voice the pitying rocks shall move,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And my complainings echo through the grove.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hear me, O Heaven! and, if a god be there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let him regard me, and accept my prayer.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Struck with these words, the tyrant’s guilty breast</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With fear and anger was by turns possess’d;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now, with remorse his conscience deeply stung,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He drew the falchion that beside him hung,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And first her tender arms behind her bound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then dragg’d her by the hair along the ground.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The princess willingly her throat reclined,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And view’d the steel with a contented mind;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But soon her tongue the girding pincers strain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With anguish, soon she feels the piercing pain:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O father, father!” she would fain have spoke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But the sharp torture her intention broke;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In vain she tries, for now the blade has cut</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her tongue sheer off, close to the trembling root;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The mangled part still quiver’d on the ground,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Murmuring with a faint, imperfect sound:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, as a serpent writhes his wounded train,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Uneasy, panting, and possess’d with pain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The piece, while life remain’d, still trembled fast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to its mistress pointed to the last.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The monarch ventures to his Procne’s sight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Loaded with guilt, and cloyed with long delight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There, with feign’d grief, and false dissembled sighs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Begins a formal narrative of lies;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her sister’s death he artfully declares,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then weeps, and raises credit from his tears.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her vest with flowers of gold embroider’d o’er,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With grief distress’d, the mournful matron tore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And a beseeming suit of gloomy sable wore.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With cost, an honorary tomb she raised,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thus the imaginary ghost appeased.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Deluded queen! the fate of her you love,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor grief, nor pity, but revenge, should move.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Through the twelve signs had pass’d the circling sun,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And round the compass of the zodiac run;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What must unhappy Philomela do,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For ever subject to her keeper’s view?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Huge walls of massy stone the lodge surround,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From her own mouth no way of speaking’s found.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But all our wants by wit may be supplied,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And art makes up what fortune has denied.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With skill exact a Phrygian web she strung,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fix’d to a loom that in her chamber hung,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where inwrought letters, upon white display’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In purple notes, her wretched case betray’d.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The piece, when finish’d, secretly she gave</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into the charge of one poor menial slave;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then, with gestures, made him understand</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It must be safe convey’d to Procne’s hand.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The slave, with speed, the queen’s apartment sought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And render’d up his charge, unknowing what he brought.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But when the ciphers, figured in each fold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her sister’s melancholy story told,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Strange that she could!) with silence she survey’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The tragic piece, and without weeping read:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In such tumultuous haste her passions sprung,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They choked her voice, and quite disarm’d her tongue.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No room for female tears; the Furies rise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Darting vindictive glances from her eyes;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, stung with rage, she bounds from place to place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While stern revenge sits low’ring in her face.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now the triennial celebration came,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Observed to Bacchus by each Thracian dame;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When, in the privacies of night retired,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They act his rites, with sacred rapture fired.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By night, the tinkling cymbals ring around,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While the shrill notes from Rhodope resound;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By night, the queen, disguised, forsakes the court,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To mingle in the festival resort:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Leaves of the curling vine her temples shade,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, with a circling wreath, adorn her head;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Adown her back the stag’s rough spoils appear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Light on her shoulder leans a cornel spear.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thus, in the fury of the god conceal’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Procne her own mad headstrong passion veil’d:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now, with her gang, to the thick wood she flies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with religious yellings fills the skies:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The fatal lodge, as ’twere by chance, she seeks,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And through the bolted doors an entrance breaks.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From thence, her sister snatching by the hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mask’d like the ranting Bacchanalian band,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Within the limits of the court she drew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shading, with ivy green, her outward hue.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But Philomela, conscious of the place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Felt new reviving pangs of her disgrace;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A shiv’ring cold prevail’d in ev’ry part,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the chill’d blood ran trembling to her heart.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Soon as the queen a fit retirement found,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Stripp’d of the garlands that her temples crown’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She straight unveil’d her blushing sister’s face,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And fondly clasp’d her with a close embrace:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, in confusion lost, the unhappy maid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With shame dejected, hung her drooping head,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As guilty of a crime that stain’d her sister’s bed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That speech, that should her injured virtue clear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And make her spotless innocence appear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is now no more, only her hands and eyes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Appeal, in signals, to the conscious skies.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In Procne’s breast the rising passions boil,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And burst in anger with a mad recoil;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her sister’s ill-timed grief with scorn she blames,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then, in these furious words, her rage proclaims:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Tears, unavailing, but defer our time,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The stabbing sword must expiate the crime;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or worse, if wit, on bloody vengeance bent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A weapon more tormenting can invent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O sister! I’ve prepared my stubborn heart</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To act some hellish and unheard-of part;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Either the palace to surround with fire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And see the villain in the flames expire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or, with a knife, dig out his cursed eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or his false tongue with racking engines seize.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tortures enough my passion has design’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But the variety distracts my mind.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Awhile thus wav’ring stood the furious dame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When Itys fondling to his mother came;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From him the cruel, fatal hint she took,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She view’d him with a stern, remorseless look;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Ah! but too like thy wicked sire,” she said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Forming the direful purpose in her head.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At this a sullen grief her voice suppress’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While silent passions struggle in her breast.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now, at her lap arrived, the flatt’ring boy</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Salutes his parent with a smiling joy:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>About her neck his little arms are thrown,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he accosts her in a prattling tone;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then her tempestuous anger was allay’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in its full career her vengeance stay’d;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While tender thoughts, in spite of passion, rise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And melting tears disarm her threat’ning eyes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, when she found the mother’s easy heart</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Too fondly swerving from the intended part,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her injured sister’s face again she view’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, as by turns, surveying both she stood.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“While this fond boy,” she said, “can thus express</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The moving accents of his fond address,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why stands my sister of her tongue bereft,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Forlorn and sad, in speechless silence left?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O Procne! see the fortune of your house;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such is your fate when match’d to such a spouse!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Conjugal duty, if observed to him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Would change from virtue, and become a crime:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For all respect to Tereus must debase</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The noble blood of great Pandion’s race.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Straight, at these words, with big resentment fill’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Furious her look, she flew and seized her child,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like a fell tigress of the savage kind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That drags the tender suckling of the hind</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through India’s gloomy groves, where Ganges laves</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The shady scene, and rolls his streamy waves.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now to a close apartment they were come,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Far off retired within the spacious dome,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When Procne, on revengeful mischief bent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Home to his heart a piercing poniard sent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Itys, with rueful cries, but all too late,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Holds out his hands, and deprecates his fate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Still at his mother’s neck he fondly aims,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And strives to melt her with endearing names;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet still the cruel mother perseveres,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor with concern his bitter anguish hears.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This might suffice; but Philomela too</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Across his throat a shining cutlass drew.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then both, with knives, dissect each quiv’ring part,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And carve the butcher’d limbs with cruel art,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which, whelm’d in boiling cauldrons o’er the fire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or, turn’d on spits, in steamy smoke aspire;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While the long entries, with their slippery floor,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Run down in purple streams of clotted gore.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Ask’d by his wife to this inhuman feast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tereus, unknowingly, is made a guest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While she, her plot the better to disguise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Styles it some unknown mystic sacrifice;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And such the nature of the hallow’d rite,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The wife her husband only could invite;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The slaves must all withdraw, and be debarr’d the sight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tereus, upon a throne of antique state,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Loftily raised, before the banquet sate;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, glutton like, luxuriously pleased,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With his own flesh his hungry maw appeased.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nay, such a blindness o’er his senses falls</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he for Itys to the table calls.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When Procne, now impatient to disclose</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The joy that from her full revenge arose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cries out, in transports of a cruel mind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Within yourself your Itys you may find.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Still at this puzzling answer, with surprise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Around the room he sends his curious eyes;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, as he still inquired, and call’d aloud,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fierce Philomela, all besmeared with blood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her hands with murder stain’d, her spreading hair</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hanging dishevell’d, with a ghastly air</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Stepp’d forth, and flung, full in the tyrant’s face,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The head of Itys, gory as it was:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor ever long’d so much to use her tongue,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with a just reproach to vindicate her wrong.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The Thracian monarch from the table flings,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While with his cries the vaulted parlour rings:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His imprecations echo down to hell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And rouse the snaky furies from their Stygian cell.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One while he labours to disgorge his breast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And free his stomach from the cursed feast;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then, weeping o’er his lamentable doom,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He styles himself his son’s sepulchral tomb.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now, with drawn sabre and impetuous speed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In close pursuit he drives Pandion’s breed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whose nimble feet spring with so swift a force</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Across the fields, they seem to wing their course.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And now on real wings themselves they raise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And steer their airy flight by different ways;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One to the woodland’s shady covert hies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Around the smoky roof the other flies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whose feathers yet the marks of murder stain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where, stamp’d upon her breast, the crimson spots remain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tereus, through grief, and haste to be revenged,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shares the like fate, and to a bird is changed:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fix’d on his head the crested plumes appear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Long is his beak, and sharpen’d like a spear:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus arm’d, his looks his inward mind display,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, to a lapwing turn’d, he fans his way.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Exceeding trouble for his children’s fate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shorten’d Pandion’s days, and changed his date;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Down to the shades below, with sorrow spent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An earlier, unexpected ghost he went.</span>

					<h3 epub:type="title">Boreas in Love</h3>
					<p epub:type="bridgehead">Boreas is enamoured of the beautiful Orithyia, whom he carries off against her inclination⁠—She afterward becomes the mother of Zethes and Calais, who accompany the Argonautic expedition.</p>
				</header>
				<p>
					<span>Erechtheus next the Athenian sceptre sway’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whose rule the state with joint consent obey’d;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So mix’d his justice with his valour flow’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His reign one scene of princely goodness show’d.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Four hopeful youths, as many females bright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sprung from his loins, and sooth’d him with delight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Two of these sisters, of a lovelier air,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Excell’d the rest, though all the rest were fair.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Procris to Cephalus in wedlock tied,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bless’d the young sylvan with a blooming bride:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For Orithyia Boreas suffer’d pain;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For the coy maid sued long, but sued in vain;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tereus, his neighbour, and his Thracian blood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Against the match a main objection stood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which made his vows, and all his suppliant love,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Empty as air, and ineffectual, prove.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But when he found his soothing flatteries fail,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor saw his soft addresses could avail,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Blustering with ire, he quickly has recourse</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To rougher arts, and his own native force.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“ ’Tis well,” he said; “such usage is my due,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When thus disguised by foreign ways I sue;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When my stern airs and fierceness I disclaim,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sigh for love, ridiculously tame;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When soft addresses foolishly I try,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor my own stronger remedies apply.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By force and violence I chiefly live,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By them the low’ring stormy tempests drive,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In foaming billows raise the hoary deep,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Writhe knotted oaks, and sandy deserts sweep,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Congeal the falling flakes of fleecy snow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bruise with rattling hail the plain below.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I and my brother winds, when join’d above,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through the waste champaign of the skies we rove,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With such a boisterous full career engage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That heaven’s whole concave thunders at our rage.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While, struck from nitrous clouds, fierce lightnings play,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dart through the storm, and gild the gloomy day:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or when, in subterraneous caverns pent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My breath against the hollow earth is bent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The quaking world above, and ghosts below,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My mighty power, by dear experience, know,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tremble with fear, and dread the fatal blow.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This is the only cure to be applied,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus to Erechtheus I should be allied;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thus the scornful virgin should be woo’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not by entreaty, but by force subdued.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Boreas, in passion, spoke these huffing things,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, as he spoke, he shook his dreadful wings,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At which, afar the shivering sea was fann’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the wide surface of the distant land:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His dusty mantle o’er the hills he drew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And swept the lowly valleys as he flew;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then, with his yellow wings, embraced the maid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, wrapp’d in dusky clouds, far off convey’d.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sparkling blaze of love’s prevailing fire</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shone brighter as he flew, and flamed the higher</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And now the god, possess’d of his delight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To northern Thrace pursued his airy flight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Two lovely twins, the effect of this embrace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Crown their soft labours, and their nuptials grace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who, like their mother, beautiful and fair,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their father’s strength, and feather’d pinions, share:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet these at first were wanting, as ’tis said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And after, as they grew, their shoulders spread.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Zethes and Calais, the pretty twins,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Remain’d unfledg’d, while smooth their beardless chins:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But when, in time, the budding silver down</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shaded their face, and on their cheeks was grown,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Two sprouting wings upon their shoulders sprung,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like those in birds, that veil the callow young.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then, as their age advanced, and they began</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From greener youth to ripen into man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With Jason’s Argonauts they cross’d the seas,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Embark’d in quest of the fam’d golden fleece;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There, with the rest, the first frail vessel tried,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And boldly ventured on the swelling tide.</span>
